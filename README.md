Low Latency + Intermittent Connectivity (Mobile Node Simulation)
ðŸ”¹ What the scenario means
This scenario emulates a mobile asset (e.g., drone, vehicle, or field unit) that has a good quality connection when in range, but frequently disconnects and reconnects due to movement or unstable radio coverage.

Unlike high latency links, this connection is fast when active, but unreliable.

ðŸ”¹ How to simulate it
Keep baseline latency low (e.g., 100ms), but simulate link loss periodically by disconnecting and reconnecting the asset from its network:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Simulate link loss for 30 seconds every few minutes
docker network disconnect net-asset3 asset3-comsgateway
sleep 30
docker network connect net-asset3 asset3-comsgateway
Optionally, you can use tc loss and delay before/after to simulate signal degradation:

bash
Copy
Edit
tc qdisc add dev ethX root netem delay 100ms loss 2%
ðŸ”¹ What you're testing (Mapped to ISD Characteristics)
ISD Characteristic Category	What We're Testing
Time Behavior	- Reconnection latency
- Resume time for sync and listeners
Sync Behavior	- Sync consistency after disconnection
- State catch-up timing
Resource Utilization	- CPU/memory spikes during resync
System Availability	- Listen reliability after reconnect
- Application resilience

ðŸ”¹ Whatâ€™s the network setup
Asset 3 is running in a Docker container on Ubuntu VM

Asset 3 is intermittently disconnected from the DDIL router

COMS Gateway uses known IPs â€” sync must resume after reconnect

All other assets stay connected to the DDIL router

Only Asset 3â€™s network is manipulated to simulate mobility

ðŸ”¹ How to measure outcomes
KPI / Metric	Measurement Method
Reconnection Time	Time from reconnect to operational sync (comsgateway logs)
Missed Message Recovery	# of messages sent during disconnect vs recovered after reconnect
Sync Catch-Up Duration	Time for Asset 3 to fully sync after rejoining
Duplicate Message Rate	Application logs (compare write/listen IDs)
System Stability	Any crashes, errors, or stuck listeners on reconnect
CPU/Memory Spikes	Docker stats, OTEL, or Prometheus monitoring
