 Recovery After Full Blackout
ðŸ”¹ What the scenario means
This scenario simulates a complete asset-level outage (e.g., due to power loss, software crash, or network failure) where the asset is:

Completely offline for an extended period (e.g., 5â€“10 minutes),

Then rejoins the network, reconnects with other assets, and must catch up on missed state and messages.

This reflects field scenarios like:

Temporary asset failure in harsh environments,

A rebooted node after mission redeployment.

ðŸ”¹ How to simulate it
Stop all containers for one asset (e.g., Asset 6):

bash
Copy
Edit
docker stop asset6-graphql asset6-zenoh asset6-comsgateway asset6-influxdb
Wait for 5+ minutes (during which other assets continue normal operations).

Restart the containers:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker start asset6-graphql asset6-zenoh asset6-comsgateway asset6-influxdb
ðŸ”¹ What you're testing (Mapped to ISD Characteristics)
ISD Characteristic Category	What We're Testing
Sync Behavior	- Replay of missed data from other assets
- COMS Gateway state re-init
Consistency & Recovery	- Data integrity after reconnection
- Eventual/strong sync resolution
Time Behavior	- Sync latency (post-blackout catch-up)
- Resolver recovery time
Resource Utilization	- CPU/Memory spike during catch-up
- Storage increase after syncing

ðŸ”¹ Whatâ€™s the network setup
All assets on a single Ubuntu VM with Docker.

Asset 6 is taken completely offline (containers stopped).

Other assets remain connected to DDIL router and continue operating normally.
